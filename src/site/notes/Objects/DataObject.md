## Introduction

`DataObject` does not interact with other instances in the `workspace`, but it stores properties of an [[Objects/ExtendedInstance\|ExtendedInstance]] of the tower.

Changing the properties of an [[Objects/ObjectBuilder\|ObjectBuilder]]-linked `DataObject`, changes or regenerates the [[Objects/ExtendedInstance\|ExtendedInstance]] connected to the `DataObject`.
